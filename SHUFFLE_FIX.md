# Shuffle Button Fix

## Issue
The Shuffle button in the Emoji Connections game wasn't properly shuffling the emojis. The original implementation tried to trigger a re-render by creating a new reference to the gameData object, but this approach didn't actually change the order of the displayed emojis.

## Changes Made

1. **Added a dedicated shuffle function in gameData.js**
   - Created a new `shuffleEmojis` function that takes an array of emojis and returns a shuffled copy

2. **Modified App.js to manage available emojis as state**
   - Added a new state variable `availableEmojis` to track the current emojis that should be displayed
   - Added an effect to update `availableEmojis` when solved groups change
   - Updated the `handleShuffle` function to properly shuffle only the available emojis

3. **Updated GameBoard component**
   - Modified the component to receive and render availableEmojis directly from props
   - Removed the `getAvailableEmojis` function since this is now managed in the App component

## Verification
The Shuffle button now properly shuffles the available emojis because:

- We maintain a separate state for available emojis
- We properly update this state when the Shuffle button is clicked
- The component rerenders with the shuffled emojis immediately

## How to Test
1. Run the game locally (`npm start`)
2. Click the Shuffle button to verify that the emojis change position
3. Make a correct match, then verify the Shuffle button still works for the remaining emojis
